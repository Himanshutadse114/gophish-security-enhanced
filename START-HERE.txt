  Gophish - Installation Guide for New Computers
============================================================

WELCOME!
  This guide will help you install Gophish on a completely
  new Windows computer with nothing installed.

============================================================
  STEP 1: Install Docker Desktop
============================================================

Docker Desktop is required to run Gophish.

1. Download Docker Desktop:
   - Go to: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
   - Or search "Docker Desktop Windows" in your browser
   - Click "Download for Windows"

2. Run the installer:
   - Double-click the downloaded file (Docker Desktop Installer.exe)
   - Follow the installation wizard
   - When asked, check "Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V" (recommended)
   - Complete the installation

3. Restart your computer:
   - The installer will prompt you to restart
   - Save any work and restart

4. After restart:
   - Start Docker Desktop from Start Menu
   - Search for "Docker Desktop" and click it
   - Wait for Docker to start (1-2 minutes)
   - Look for whale icon in system tray (bottom right)
   - Icon should be steady (not animated) when ready

============================================================
  STEP 2: Run Prerequisites Check (Optional)
============================================================

Before installing Gophish, you can check if everything is ready:

1. Double-click: check-requirements.bat
2. This will verify Docker is installed and running
3. If all checks pass, proceed to Step 3

============================================================
  STEP 3: Install Gophish
============================================================

1. Double-click: setup.bat
2. The script will:
   - Check if Docker is ready
   - Build the Gophish image (5-10 minutes first time)
   - Start the container
   - Show you login credentials

3. Wait for setup to complete
   - First time: 5-10 minutes
   - Subsequent times: 1-2 minutes

============================================================
  STEP 4: Access Gophish
============================================================

After setup completes:

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: https://localhost:8443
3. You'll see a security warning (this is normal)
   - Click "Advanced" or "Details"
   - Click "Proceed to localhost" or "Continue"
4. Login with credentials shown in setup.bat output

============================================================
  TROUBLESHOOTING
============================================================

Problem: "Docker is not installed"
Solution: Follow Step 1 above to install Docker Desktop

Problem: "Docker daemon is not running"
Solution: Start Docker Desktop from Start Menu and wait

Problem: "This site can't be reached"
Solution: Wait 60-90 seconds after setup, services need time to start
